    <p>These hearty, delicious eggplant "meatballs" can be used as a vegetarian replacement for real meatballs, or they can be formed into patties and cooked like burgers.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>4 cups cubed eggplant, with peel</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>¾ cup dry bread crumbs, or more as needed</li>
        <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and sauté until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in eggplant and water. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and steam until eggplant is soft, about 20 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl and let cool for 5 to 10 minutes.

        </li>
        <li>Add parsley, bread crumbs, Parmesan, and eggs to eggplant; mix with a wooden spoon or your hands until thoroughly combined and mixture can be rolled into balls. Add more bread crumbs as needed to make mixture workable. Cover and refrigerate for 15 minutes.

        </li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.

        </li>
        <li>Roll chilled eggplant mixture into 18 balls; place onto the prepared baking sheet.

        </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Serve immediately.

        </li>
    </ol>
